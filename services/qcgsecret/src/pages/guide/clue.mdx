For this step, you will need to obtain the 12 Neptunia frames, located at these locations:

<Dropdown title="Dining room" client:only="react">

</Dropdown>

<Dropdown title="Attic" client:only="react">
	<img src="/assets/guide/clue/frames/frames/attic.png" width="672" />
</Dropdown>

Once you have them all, bring the frames to the main doors. A clock signal will be emitted, and an orb will appear and enter the weapon's locked container in the middle.

</Step>

<Header title="Sacrificial Ritual" id="ritual">
	3 players - Only Bystander
</Header>

<Step>
You will need to get a hidden cross from the television room, located on the locked containers and put it in the puddle that does not have a cross in the rope room.

<img src="/assets/guide/clue/ritual/pond2.png" width="360" height="238" />
Next, all three must use the rope. Each person will make all the cross burn. Once completed, a completion cue will be played
and the locked containers will be unlocked and you can find an ammo box inside..

</Step>

<Header title="Wild West" id="wildwest">
	4 Sherrifs
</Header>

<Step>
	Upon completion of each previous step, you will need to get 4 sheriffs ready for each gong.
	<Dropdown title="Attic" client:only="react">
		<img src="/assets/guide/clue/wildwest/gong/gongattic.png" width="672" />
	</Dropdown>
	<Dropdown title="Basement" client:only="react">

		<img src="/assets/guide/clue/wildwest/gong/gongmid2.png" width="672" />
	</Dropdown>
	They'll need to shoot at the same time their gong. One of them will have to start a countdown to get everybody synced
	up. If everyone shoots at the same time, all gongs will emit a powerful sound and break the glass containers at the
	entrance. Otherwise, it means they fail, so retry.
</Step>

<Header title="Breaking out" id="breakingout">
	1 player
</Header>

<Step>
	A player will have to grab the Gun in the now free by interacting with it, wuth your action key. Once done, go to the
	TV room to collide it with the ammo box. And hurry to the main gate to throw the weapon on it. The door will shatter
	and a metal door will close on a weird portal to keep you from leaving.
</Step>

<Header title="Bell Rush" id="bell">
	4 player
</Header>

<Step>
By shooting the bell in the middle with a gun, orbs will begin to appear, you need to gather them as quickly as possible. Thoses orbs spawn in the same order in every game, so having a player close to the spawn is great!

The first orb spawn in front of the door, followed after on who spawn in the middle. The third spawn in front of the TV, in the closet room. After, the 4th one spawn in the attic on the beams, making you do a little some parkour. The fifth is just between the two doors leading to the Maho bedroom. The 6th one in the tunnel just under the piano room. The 7th is directly in front of the switch and the last one is just on a barrel in the basement.
